# Classification and Regression - from linear and logistic regression to neural networks

In this project we will be using a FFNN to study both classification and regression problems. The Network is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) method and will be tested using various activations functions for the hidden layers, such as Sigmoid , Softmax, RELU and Leaky RELU. For regression we will again use data created using the Franke Function, as we did in project 1 \cite{project1}. For classification we will be using the MNIST dataset, which contains images representing hand-written numbers from zero to nine.  

## Folders

- code: Contains all the code files, the minst data file, a full description of the code can be found in a separate README file in this folder.  
- figures: contains some of the figures generated uing our code
- output: contains datafiles generated using out code

This code builds on example-code used/created by Morten Hjorth-Jensen for the class [FYS-STK4155](https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/)


It also uses portions of the scripts written by Michael Nielsen which can be found in his github repository[https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)
