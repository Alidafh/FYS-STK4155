# Regression analysis and resampling methods

## Overview of files:
Files in this routine
plotting.py  

## How to run:
Run the analysis using

```
source run.sh
```
If they do not exist already, the following folders are created:
- output/figures

## Credits
If code is sourced from someone else

### TO-DO:
a) Ordinary least squares on the Franke function
  - Scale data
  - Split data into training set and a test set
  - Need function for OLS
b) Bias-variance trade-off and resampling techniques\
c) Cross-validation as resampling techniques\
d) Ridge regression on the Franke function with resampling\
e) Lasso Regression on the Franke function with resampling\
f) Introducing real data and preparing the data analysis\
g) OLS, Ridge and Lasso regression with resampling\
